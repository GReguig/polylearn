===============================================
Factorization machine decision boundary for XOR
===============================================

Plots the decision function learned by a factorization machine for a noisy
non-linearly separable XOR problem

This problem is a perfect example of feature interactions. As such,
factorization machines can model it very robustly with a very small number of
parameters.  (In this case, n_features * n_components = 2 * 1 = 2 params.)
